## Features

OnTimed offers the following features:

### Project Management

-   **Remove Projects:** Delete projects when they are no longer needed. Note that removing a project also removes its associated tasks.
-   **Edit Projects:** Change the name and icon of your projects, and the tasks' project name will be automatically updated to reflect the changes.

### Task Management

-   **Create Tasks:** Within each project, you can create tasks with titles, due dates, priorities, descriptions, and notes.

-   **Create Tasks in Project Groups:** You can create tasks within the selected project group.
-   **Filter Tasks:** Use filtering options to group tasks by priority flags (high, medium, normal) and status flags (overdue, ongoing, completed).
